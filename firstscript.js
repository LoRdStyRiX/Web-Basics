//theres 4 ways to declare variables
// 1. automatic
// 2. var
// 3. let
// 4. const

// automatic variable------------------
x = 420;
y = 69;
z = x+y;

console.log(z);

//var variable (can be re-declared)

var a //this is called hoisting

var a = 69;
var b = 420;
var a = 666;

console.log(a);

//let variable (cant be re-declared but can be changed)

let a = 69
let b = 99

a = 70
console.log(a)

//const variable (cannot be re-declared and changed)
const a = 'fire'
const b = 'water'


console.log(a)


//arithmetic

//addition = (+)
//substraction = (-)
//multiplication = (*)
//division = (/)
//modulus = division leftover

//increment (from small to big) = ++
//decrement (from big to small) = --

//comparison operator
//equal to = (==)
//equal value and type = (===)
//not equal to = (!=)

//greater than = (>)
//less than = (<)
//greater than or equal = (>=)
//less than or equal = (<=)
//ternary = (?

//types of data in JS

//string = ('') "insert numbers or letters"
//number = data type that stores decimals
//bigint = data type that stores integers (bilangan bulat)
//boolean = true/false
